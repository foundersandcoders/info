LOCATION AND DIRECTIONS

Founders & Coders Nazareth is based at the Nazareth Cultural & Tourism Association, inside the Khan El Basha Building, across from the Basilica of the Annunciation.

Nazareth is a small city of 75,000 people, with a mixed Christian and Muslim population. It is considered the center of Arab society in Israel. 

HOURS

Our Nazareth programme runs Sunday through Thursday from 10 AM to 6 PM.

DATES

Our next programmes begin in June 2017, October 2017, and February 2018. Applications for the June programme close April 30.

Each programme runs for 16 weeks. After graduation, you will be expected to help mentor the following cohort, and we will help you find employment. 

ELIGIBILITY

If you are over the age of 18 and can legally enter Israel, you are eligible to apply for our Nazareth programme. 

We welcome international applicants who commit to spending 16 weeks in Israel. Israel grants 90 day tourist visas to UK travelers at the border. For a small fee, UK residents can apply in advance for a tourist visa extension, or apply for one once they are in the country by visiting a Ministry of Interior office. Please note that students coming from outside Israel will not receive any financial support during the programme.

Founders & Coders has no academic requirements. We find that successful students are self-motivated, prepared to work long hours, and committed to collaborative working. Coding also requires a deep curiosity about how things work and a certain stubbornness in the face of repeated failure.

ACCOMMODATION

We will help local students find affordable housing in Nazareth, including flats for women only.

Founders & Coders manages a guesthouse in Nazareth for our international students and mentors, located across the street from our campus at Khan el-Basha. Rent for a private room is £300 a month. Food prices are similar to those in the UK and Europe. 

STIPENDS

At this time, we do not offer financial support to local or international students.

We are actively exploring ways to provide a modest living stipend to local students.

PARTNERS

Founders & Coders Nazareth is a partnership between Founders & Coders International, the UK Israel Tech Hub, and the Nazareth Cultural & Tourism Assoication.
